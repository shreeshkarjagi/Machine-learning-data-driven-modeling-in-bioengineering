# Machine-learning-data-driven-modeling-in-bioengineering

This repository contains notebooks from my Machine Learning class. The notebooks cover various topics related to machine learning and data analysis. This project-based class will introduce techniques for inferring biological meaning from experimental measurements using computational and analytical techniques.
