# Machine-learning-data-driven-modeling-in-bioengineering

This repository contains notebooks from my Machine Learning class. The notebooks cover various topics related to machine learning and data analysis. This project-based class will introduce techniques for inferring biological meaning from experimental measurements using computational and analytical techniques. 

## Week 1 - Introduction
[Week1-Introduction](https://github.com/shreeshkarjagi/Machine-learning-data-driven-modeling-in-bioengineering/blob/main/lab-1-programming-and-git-primer-shreeshkarjagi/Week1-Introduction.ipynb)
In this week, we introduce the basic concepts of Git and Python programming language. You can find the following tutorials in this week's notebook:

- A quick introduction to git and python
- Tutorials on git functions and further reading on git
- Introduction to python programming with tutorials on Python basics

## Week 2 - Implementation of Shaffer et al
